# YMusify
This is the client-side app for music transfer between Spotify and Yandex.Music.

See https://solospirit.github.io/YMusify/

But first read all the info below!

## Alpha version
Currently you can use music transfer from Spotify to Yandex.Music. Reverse transfer method hasn't been implemented yet.
Music transfer is available in test mode locally using proxy cors-anywhere. It is available only if it is permitted by my Spotify account to yours.
If you somehow got here and you want to test this little thing, contact me via email: sergei.simonov.d@gmail.com

## Someday I'll release it
Originally I wrote this app and related APIs only for transfer my music form Spotify to Yandex.Music as i didn't want to pay another services. Maybe someday I'll upgrade it and release :)
